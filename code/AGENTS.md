# Code Pipeline Conventions

These conventions apply to all scripts in `code/` and its subdirectories.
The default empirical economics workflow is Make + R/Stata. Julia and MATLAB
remain supported for projects that need simulation, numerical optimization, or
structural modeling.

---

## Path Style

- Use forward slashes in any literal filepath on every platform, including
  Windows (for example `../../output/tables/results.csv`)
- Never write Windows-style backslashes in path literals
- Path helpers such as `file.path()`, `joinpath()`, and `fullfile()` remain
  preferred for programmatic path construction

---

## Empirical Economics Pipeline Principles

- Separate raw cleaning, sample construction, estimation, robustness checks,
  tables, figures, and manuscript numbers into explicit Make targets.
- Persist analysis datasets, estimation outputs, robustness outputs, tables,
  figures, and dynamic-number files under the repo-root `output/` directory.
- Treat merge keys, sample restrictions, fixed effects, clustering, weights,
  and treatment timing as first-class research objects, not incidental code.
- Check merge and reshape invariants before estimating anything downstream.
- Keep computed results out of prose; write them to `output/numbers/` and input
  them from LaTeX.

---

## R Code Standards

**Standard:** Senior Principal Data Engineer + PhD researcher quality

### 1. Reproducibility

- `set.seed()` called ONCE at top (YYYYMMDD format)
- All packages loaded at top via `library()` (not `require()`)
- All paths relative to the script working directory (usually `code/[task_group]/`)
- Rely on the Makefile to make directories

### 2. Function Design

- `snake_case` naming, verb-noun pattern
- Roxygen-style documentation
- Default parameters, no magic numbers
- Named return values (lists or tibbles)

### 3. Domain Correctness

<!-- Customize for your field's known pitfalls -->
- Verify estimator implementations match paper formulas (`latex/manuscript.tex`)
- Make sample restrictions, treatment definitions, controls, fixed effects,
  clusters, and weights explicit near the model code
- Save main and robustness estimates in machine-readable outputs before
  rendering tables or figures
- Check known package bugs (document below in Common Pitfalls)

### 4. Visual Identity

```r
# --- Your institutional palette ---
plot_blue = "#4575b4"
plot_mid = "#ffffdf"
plot_red = "#d73027"
plot_purple = "#c51b7d"
plot_green = "#3a7813"
```

#### Fonts
```
sysfonts::font_add_google("Lato")
sysfonts::font_add_google("Fira Sans")
```

#### Custom Themes
```r
# Regular plots
main_theme <-
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    title = element_text(size = 24),
    text = element_text(family = font_choice),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 30), axis.text.y = element_text(size = 30),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 30), axis.title.y = element_text(size = 30),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(), panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(), panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), axis.ticks = element_line(colour = "black"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#ffffff")
  )

# Maps
map_theme <-
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.key.height = unit(.35, "cm"),
    legend.key.width = unit(.6, "cm"),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),
    text = element_text(family = "Lato"),
  )
```

#### Figure Dimensions (for slides template)
```r
# Maps
ggsave(filepath, width = 8, height = 4, bg = "transparent")
# Figures
ggsave(filepath, width = 8, height = 8, bg = "transparent")
```

### 5. Output Paths

Task-group scripts usually run from `code/[task_group]/`, so paths are
relative to that working directory. In the standard layout, define
`output_root` once and write into the canonical subdirectories under the
repo-root `output/` directory:

```r
output_root = file.path("..", "..", "output")

# Figures
ggsave(file.path(output_root, "figures", "my_plot.pdf"), width = 8, height = 8, bg = "transparent")

# Tables / RDS
saveRDS(result, file.path(output_root, "tables", "my_results.rds"))

# Inline numbers for manuscript (\newcommand .txt files)
writeLines("\\newcommand{\\myEstimate}{2.31}",
           file.path(output_root, "numbers", "my_estimate.txt"))
```

**Heavy computations saved as RDS; slide rendering loads pre-computed data.**

### 6. Common Pitfalls

<!-- Add your field-specific pitfalls here -->
| Pitfall | Impact | Prevention |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Missing `bg = "transparent"` | White boxes on slides | Always include in ggsave() |
| Hardcoded paths | Breaks on other machines | Use relative paths |
| Silent sample drift | Estimates change without explanation | Save sample counts and restriction logs |
| Implicit clustering or weights | Wrong inferential target | Declare clustering and weights next to each specification |

### 7. Line Length & Mathematical Exceptions

**Standard:** Keep lines <= 120 characters.

**Exception:** Mathematical formulas may exceed 120 chars if breaking the line would harm readability, an inline comment explains the operation, and the line is in a numerically intensive section.

### 8. Code Quality Checklist

```
[ ] Packages at top via library()
[ ] set.seed() once at top
[ ] All paths relative to the script working directory
[ ] Functions documented (Roxygen)
[ ] Figures: transparent bg, explicit dimensions
[ ] RDS: every computed object saved
[ ] Estimation outputs include sample counts, specification labels, clusters, and weights where relevant
[ ] Comments explain WHY not WHAT
```

## Optional Julia Code Standards

**Standard:** Senior Principal Computational Scientist + PhD researcher quality

### 1. Reproducibility

- `Random.seed!(YYYYMMDD)` called ONCE at top (YYYYMMDD format) **ONCE CHOOSING A SEED DO NOT CHANGE IT AGAIN**
- All dependencies loaded at top via `using` or `import`
- All paths relative to the script working directory using `joinpath()`
- Rely on the Makefile to make directories

### 2. Function Design

- `snake_case` for functions and variables, `CamelCase` for types and modules
- Verb-noun pattern (e.g., `run_simulation`, `generate_dgp`, `compute_effect`)
- Triple-quoted docstrings with signature, arguments, and return type
- Default parameters for all tuning values, no magic numbers
- Return `NamedTuple` or custom `struct` (not bare tuples)

### 3. Domain Correctness

<!-- Customize for your field's known pitfalls -->
- Verify estimator/simulation implementations match paper formulas (`latex/manuscript.tex`)
- Check known package bugs
- Be aware of Float64 precision differences vs R

### 4. Output Paths & Data Persistence

Task-group scripts usually run from `code/[task_group]/`, so paths are
relative to that working directory. In the standard layout, define
`output_root` once and write into the canonical subdirectories under the
repo-root `output/` directory:

```julia
output_root = joinpath("..", "..", "output")

# Figures
savefig(joinpath(output_root, "figures", "my_plot.pdf"))

# Tables / data
CSV.write(joinpath(output_root, "tables", "my_results.csv"), df)

# Inline numbers for manuscript
open(joinpath(output_root, "numbers", "my_estimate.txt"), "w") do io
    println(io, "\\newcommand{\\myEstimate}{2.31}")
end
```

**Heavy computations saved to disk; downstream scripts load pre-computed data.**

Prefer JLD2 for Julia-native objects. Use CSV for model output. When saving parameterized results, include parameter values in filenames (ASCII only, strip hats).

### 5. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Impact | Prevention |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Global variables in hot loops | Severe performance regression | Pass as arguments or use `const` |
| Abstract-typed struct fields | Type instability, slow dispatch | Always annotate fields with concrete types |
| `1:length(x)` instead of `eachindex(x)` | Off-by-one risk with OffsetArrays | Use `eachindex(x)` or `axes(x, dim)` |
| Unfused broadcasts | Allocates intermediates | Use `@.` macro |
| Missing `@views` on slices | Allocates copies | Wrap in `@views` |
| Hardcoded paths | Breaks on other machines | Use `joinpath()` with relative paths |

### 6. Line Length

**Standard:** Keep lines <= 92 characters (Julia community convention). Mathematical formulas may exceed 92 chars under the same conditions as R.

### 7. Type Stability & Performance

- Run `@code_warntype` on hot functions during development
- Struct fields must have concrete types (no `Any`, no abstract types)
- Use `const` for module-level constants
- Use `@views` to avoid allocating array slices in loops
- Pre-allocate output arrays when size is known

### 8. Broadcasting & Fusion

- Prefer `@.` macro for multi-operation broadcast expressions
- Use `map` / `reduce` / comprehensions for non-broadcastable transforms
- Avoid allocating intermediate arrays where fused broadcasts suffice

### 9. Code Quality Checklist

```
[ ] Dependencies loaded at top via using/import
[ ] Random.seed!() once at top
[ ] All paths relative via joinpath() from the script working directory
[ ] Functions documented (triple-quoted docstrings)
[ ] JLD2: every computed object saved
[ ] Comments explain WHY not WHAT
[ ] Struct fields have concrete types
[ ] Hot loops use @views and pre-allocation
[ ] Broadcasts fused with @. where applicable
```

## Stata Code Standards

**Standard:** Senior Principal Econometrician + PhD researcher quality

### 1. Reproducibility

- `version` pinned near the top of each script or program
- `set more off` in batch scripts
- `set seed` called ONCE at top if stochastic operations are present
- All paths relative to the script working directory (usually `code/[task_group]/`)
- No hardcoded absolute paths and no `cd`
- Prefer local macros and program arguments over global macros
- Rely on the Makefile to make directories

### 2. Program Design

- Wrap reusable logic in `program define`
- Use `syntax` to validate arguments and options for non-trivial programs
- Use `tempfile`, `tempname`, and `tempvar` for temporary state
- Keep locals descriptive and scoped tightly
- Avoid magic numbers; lift them into named locals or documented parameters

### 3. Data Integrity & Domain Correctness

- Verify estimators and transformations match paper formulas (`latex/manuscript.tex`)
- Check merge keys with `isid`, `duplicates report`, or `assert`
- After `merge`, inspect `_merge` and assert the expected match pattern
- After `reshape`, assert the expected observation count and key uniqueness
- Log sample restrictions and assert expected observation counts after major filters
- Set `xtset` / `tsset` explicitly for panel or time-series work
- Match treatment timing, fixed effects, clustering, and weight choices to the intended estimand
- Export main and robustness estimates with specification labels, sample sizes,
  fixed effects, clusters, and weights preserved for table scripts

### 4. Output Paths

Task-group scripts usually run from `code/[task_group]/`, so paths are
relative to that working directory. In the standard layout, define
`output_root` once and write into the canonical subdirectories under the
repo-root `output/` directory:

```stata
local output_root "../../output"

save "`output_root'/tables/my_results.dta", replace
export delimited using "`output_root'/tables/my_results.csv", replace

file open fh using "`output_root'/numbers/my_estimate.txt", write text replace
file write fh "\newcommand{\myEstimate}{2.31}" _n
file close fh
```

**Heavy computations should be saved to disk; downstream scripts should load pre-computed data where possible.**

### 5. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Impact | Prevention |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Missing `version` | Results may change across Stata releases | Pin `version` at top |
| Hardcoded paths or `cd` | Breaks on other machines | Use repo-relative paths only |
| Unchecked `_merge` after `merge` | Silent sample corruption | Assert expected `_merge` values |
| Unlogged sample restrictions | Results are hard to audit | Record counts before and after filters |
| Mismatched FE or clustering | Wrong identifying variation or inference | Keep FE and cluster choices next to each specification |
| Globals for routine state | Hidden dependencies across scripts | Prefer locals and `syntax` |
| `capture` without `_rc` check | Real failures get silenced | Check `_rc` immediately |
| Unbalanced `preserve` / `restore` | Wrong dataset state later in script | Keep blocks tight and paired |
| Hidden sort dependence | Wrong grouped calculations | Use `sort` / `bysort` explicitly |

### 6. Line Length & Continuations

**Standard:** Keep lines <= 100 characters where practical. Use `///` continuations consistently, and align long option lists when that improves readability.

### 7. Code Quality Checklist

```
[ ] version pinned at top
[ ] set more off in batch scripts
[ ] set seed once at top if stochastic
[ ] All paths relative and no cd
[ ] Programs documented and arguments validated with syntax
[ ] merge/reshape steps checked with assert/isid/duplicates logic
[ ] sample restrictions logged with before/after counts
[ ] fixed effects, clustering, weights, and treatment timing are explicit
[ ] Outputs saved under the repo-root output/ directory via relative paths
[ ] Comments explain WHY not WHAT
[ ] capture followed by _rc checks
[ ] preserve/restore blocks are balanced
```

## Optional MATLAB Code Standards

**Standard:** Senior Principal Computational Scientist + PhD researcher quality

### 1. Reproducibility

- `rng()` called ONCE at top if stochastic operations are present (never inside loops/functions)
- All paths relative to the script working directory (usually `code/[task_group]/`)
- Path construction uses `filesep` or `fullfile()` for cross-platform compatibility
- No hardcoded absolute paths (e.g., `/Users/...`, `C:\Users\...`)
- Rely on the Makefile to make directories (when Makefiles exist)

### 2. Function Design

- Consistent naming convention (`snake_case` matching existing codebase)
- Comment-block docstring immediately after function signature:
  ```matlab
  function [obj, grad, H] = objective_fn(x, data, Params)
  % OBJECTIVE_FN  Compute objective, gradient, and Hessian.
  %
  %   [obj, grad, H] = objective_fn(x, data, Params)
  %
  %   Inputs:
  %     x      - Parameter vector (N x 1)
  %     data   - Structure with fields: ...
  %     Params - Configuration structure with fields: ...
  %
  %   Outputs:
  %     obj  - Scalar objective value
  %     grad - Gradient vector (N x 1)
  %     H    - Hessian matrix (N x N)
  ```
- Use `Params` struct for configuration and tuning values (no magic numbers)
- Input validation via `assert()` for critical dimensions

### 3. Domain Correctness

- Verify objective function implementations match paper formulas (`latex/manuscript.tex`)
- Check known package/solver bugs (document below in Common Pitfalls)

### 4. Solver Configuration

Projects using optimization should follow a dual-solver pattern (e.g., KNITRO + fmincon) controlled by a configuration flag. Key requirements:
- Option file paths constructed with `filesep` or `fullfile()`
- Hessian callback matches the wrapper signature
- Both solver paths should produce consistent results
- Always check `exitflag` after solver call

### 5. Output Paths

Task-group scripts usually run from `code/[task_group]/`, so paths are
relative to that working directory. In the standard layout, define
`output_root` once and write into the canonical subdirectories under the
repo-root `output/` directory:

```matlab
output_root = fullfile("..", "..", "output");

writetable(results, fullfile(output_root, "tables", "results.csv"));
writematrix(data, fullfile(output_root, "tables", "output.csv"));
save(fullfile(output_root, "tables", "results.mat"), "results", "params");
```

Projects with a `Params` struct may wrap these paths (e.g., `Params.outputdir`
instead of `output_root`), but the canonical subdirectories (`tables/`,
`figures/`, `numbers/`) remain the same.

### 6. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Impact | Prevention |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Hardcoded absolute paths | Breaks on other machines | Use relative paths with `filesep` |
| Unchecked solver `exitflag` | **Silent convergence failure (Critical, -20)** | Always check `exitflag > 0` |
| Missing NaN/Inf guards | Solver crashes or wrong results | Check before and after optimization |
| Inconsistent index trimming | Wrong data alignment | Trim all parallel arrays identically |
| `i`/`j` as loop variables | Shadows complex unit | Use `ii`, `jj`, `kk` or descriptive names |
| Asymmetric Hessian | **Silently wrong results (Critical, -25)** | Symmetrize: `H = (H + H') / 2` |
| Missing semicolons | Unwanted console output | End assignment lines with `;` |

### 7. Line Length

**Standard:** Keep lines <= 120 characters. Mathematical formulas may exceed 120 chars if breaking the line would harm readability, an inline comment explains the operation, and the line is in a numerically intensive section.

### 8. Code Quality Checklist

```
[ ] rng() once at top (if stochastic)
[ ] All paths relative with filesep/fullfile() from the script working directory
[ ] Functions documented (comment-block docstrings)
[ ] Solver exitflag checked after every optimization call
[ ] NaN/Inf guards on data input and solver output
[ ] Hessian symmetry verified
[ ] Output files saved (writetable/writematrix/save)
[ ] Comments explain WHY not WHAT
[ ] No magic numbers (use Params struct)
[ ] Semicolons on all assignment lines
```

## Makefile Conventions

Makefiles are the audit trail for the empirical pipeline. Every script that
creates an analysis dataset, estimate, robustness result, table, figure, or
dynamic manuscript number should be reachable from a Make target.

### Structure

- Every Makefile has `all` and `clean` as `.PHONY` targets
- `all` is the default (first) target and builds everything in that directory
- `clean` removes all generated outputs
- Root Makefile delegates to sub-Makefiles with a `$(MAKE) -C` loop

### Directory Creation

Use order-only prerequisites for output subdirectories. In task-group
Makefiles under `code/[task_group]/`, keep script prerequisites local and route
generated files to the repo-root `output/` directory through a relative output
root:

```make
OUTPUT_ROOT = ../../output

$(OUTPUT_ROOT)/tables/results.csv: analysis.R | $(OUTPUT_ROOT)/tables
	Rscript $<
$(OUTPUT_ROOT)/figures/plot.pdf: figures.R | $(OUTPUT_ROOT)/figures
	Rscript $<
$(OUTPUT_ROOT)/numbers/estimate.txt: analysis.R | $(OUTPUT_ROOT)/numbers
	Rscript $<

$(OUTPUT_ROOT)/tables $(OUTPUT_ROOT)/figures $(OUTPUT_ROOT)/numbers:
	mkdir -p $@
```

Scripts must NOT create directories themselves. The Makefile owns all directory creation.

### Cross-Makefile Dependencies

```make
OUTPUT_ROOT = ../../output

$(OUTPUT_ROOT)/tables/sibling_output.csv:
	$(MAKE) -C ../sibling_dir $(OUTPUT_ROOT)/tables/sibling_output.csv
```

### Expensive Intermediates

Mark expensive-to-produce files as `.PRECIOUS` so Make does not delete them on interruption.

### Pattern Rules

```make
OUTPUT_ROOT = ../../output
STATA ?= stata-mp

$(OUTPUT_ROOT)/tables/%.rds: %.R | $(OUTPUT_ROOT)/tables
	Rscript $<

$(OUTPUT_ROOT)/tables/%.csv: %.jl | $(OUTPUT_ROOT)/tables
	julia $<

$(OUTPUT_ROOT)/tables/%.dta: %.do | $(OUTPUT_ROOT)/tables
	$(STATA) -b do $<
```

### Joint Production

When a single script produces multiple outputs, declare one primary target with the recipe and secondary targets with an empty recipe (`;`).

```make
OUTPUT_ROOT = ../../output

$(OUTPUT_ROOT)/tables/results.csv $(OUTPUT_ROOT)/figures/diagnostics.pdf: analysis.R | $(OUTPUT_ROOT)/tables $(OUTPUT_ROOT)/figures
	Rscript $<
$(OUTPUT_ROOT)/figures/diagnostics.pdf: $(OUTPUT_ROOT)/tables/results.csv ;
```

### Recipe Conventions

- R scripts: `Rscript $<`
- Julia scripts: `julia $<`
- Stata scripts: `$(STATA) -b do $<` with `STATA ?= stata-mp` (or your local Stata binary)
- MATLAB scripts: `matlab -batch "run('$<')"`
- Always use `$<` (first prerequisite) and `$@` (target) automatic variables
- Never use absolute paths
- In task-group Makefiles, keep script prerequisites local (`analysis.R`) and
  route outputs through `$(OUTPUT_ROOT)`

### Root Makefile Pattern

The project root Makefile delegates to `code/` and `latex/`:

```make
SUBDIRS = code latex

.PHONY: all clean $(SUBDIRS)

all: $(SUBDIRS)

$(SUBDIRS):
	$(MAKE) -C $@

clean:
	for dir in $(SUBDIRS); do $(MAKE) -C $$dir clean; done
```

The `code/Makefile` in turn delegates to sub-Makefiles in each task-group directory.

### Validation

- `make -n` (dry-run) must produce a valid plan
- Every `.R`, `.jl`, `.do`, `.ado`, and `.m` file under `code/` should appear as a prerequisite in some Makefile target -- orphaned scripts are a warning sign
- Main estimates, robustness checks, tables, figures, and dynamic-number files
  should be declared as explicit targets or prerequisites rather than produced
  only as undocumented side effects
