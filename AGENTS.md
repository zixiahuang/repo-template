# AGENTS.md -- Empirical Economics Workflow with Codex CLI

<!-- HOW TO USE: Replace [BRACKETED PLACEHOLDERS] with your project info.
     Keep this file under 32KB -- Codex loads it every session.
     Code-specific conventions are in code/AGENTS.md.
     LaTeX-specific conventions are in latex/AGENTS.md. -->

**Institution:** [YOUR INSTITUTION]

## Core Principles

- **Plan first** -- think through the approach before non-trivial tasks; save plans to `quality_reports/plans/`
- **Verify after** -- compile/render and confirm output at the end of every task
- **Single source of truth** -- `latex/manuscript.tex` is authoritative for the paper
- **Quality gates** -- nothing ships below 80/100
- **Structured [LEARN] tags** -- when corrected or when you discover a durable lesson, save a structured `[LEARN:category]` entry to `MEMORY.md`

---

## Project Knowledge Protocol

Before planning or implementing non-trivial tasks, read:

- `knowledge/README.md`
- `knowledge/project.md`
- `knowledge/findings.md`
- `MEMORY.md`

Treat `AGENTS.md` as workflow instructions and `knowledge/` as empirical
research background. Store project-specific details -- research question,
datasets, sample definitions, variables, treatment, identification, findings,
open questions, and things to avoid -- in `knowledge/`, not in `AGENTS.md`.

If additional knowledge files are created later, follow `knowledge/README.md`
for the current reading order.

## Orchestrator Protocol: Contractor Mode

> Use this full loop for multi-file or cross-cutting changes. For single-file R/Stata scripts, use the simplified research orchestrator below. Julia/MATLAB support remains available for projects that need simulation, numerical optimization, or structural models.

**After a plan is approved, the orchestrator takes over autonomously.**

### The Loop

```
Plan approved -> orchestrator activates
  |
  Step 1: IMPLEMENT -- Execute plan steps
  |
  Step 2: VERIFY -- Run `make -n` to check staleness; build stale targets
  |         If Makefile exists: `make -C code/[dir] [target]` or `make -C latex`
  |         Otherwise: compile/render/run directly
  |         If verification fails -> fix -> re-verify
  |
  Step 3: REVIEW -- Run appropriate review skill (/review-r, /review-julia, /review-stata, /review-matlab, /review-tex)
  |
  Step 4: FIX -- Apply fixes (critical -> major -> minor)
  |
  Step 5: RE-VERIFY -- Confirm fixes are clean
  |
  Step 6: SCORE -- Apply quality-gates rubric
  |
  └── Score >= threshold?
        YES -> Continue to Step 7
        NO  -> Loop back to Step 3 (max 5 rounds)
              After max rounds -> continue to Step 7 with remaining issues
  |
  Step 7: OPTIONAL REVIEWS -- If the approved plan requests them:
  |         * Domain substance review -> run domain-reviewer agent
  |         * Proofreading -> run proofreader agent
  |         These run once on the final state, after the review-fix loop.
  |         They produce reports only -- fixes require user review.
  |         Skip this step if the plan does not request optional reviews.
  |
  Step 8: Present summary to user (including optional review reports)
```

### Limits

- **Main loop:** max 5 review-fix rounds
- **Critic-fixer sub-loop:** max 5 rounds
- **Verification retries:** max 2 attempts
- Never loop indefinitely

### "Just Do It" Mode

When user says "just do it" / "handle it":
- Skip final approval pause
- Auto-commit if score >= 80
- Still run the full verify-review-fix loop
- Still present the summary

### Structured Handoff Rule

For multi-file or cross-cutting tasks, write a short handoff note before moving
between major stages. Use `templates/handoff.md` and save notes under:

```
quality_reports/handoffs/YYYY-MM-DD_description/
```

Default stage boundaries:

- `01_plan-to-implement.md`
- `02_implement-to-verify.md`
- `03_verify-to-review.md`
- `04_review-to-summary.md`

Skip handoffs for trivial single-script tasks handled entirely inside the
simplified research orchestrator.

---

## Refactoring Protocol

### Constraints

- NEVER change solver tolerances, options, or convergence criteria
- NEVER rename variables in numerical/hot-loop code
- NEVER change function signatures without explicit approval
- NEVER remove dead code unless explicitly instructed (flag it in section headers instead)
- The ONLY acceptable refactoring outcome is identical output

### Verify-Refactor-Verify Loop

1. Run target script, record output checksums (CSV only -- skip binary formats like RDS, .mat, PDF)
2. Apply style changes per language convention rules
3. Re-run, compare checksums
4. If mismatch: revert and report -- do not attempt to fix the mismatch

### Approved Transformations

- Comment style (headers, borders, docstrings)
- Whitespace and indentation
- Variable grouping and section organization
- Adding missing documentation
- Language-specific style conventions

### Prohibited Transformations (without explicit approval)

- Changing algorithm logic or control flow
- Renaming function parameters or return values
- Modifying solver configuration or tolerances
- Removing or restructuring error handling
- Changing data types or precision
- Refactoring loops into vectorized form (or vice versa) in numerical code

When in doubt, ask before changing.

---

## Solver Debugging Protocol

When debugging numerical solver failures (MATLAB, Julia, Python):

### Diagnostic Checklist (follow in order)

1. **Dimensions first** -- verify all matrices are conformable, vectors are correct length
2. **NaN/Inf trace** -- find the first operation that produces NaN; trace backward
3. **Finite-difference check** -- validate analytic gradients/Hessians before suspecting derivative bugs
4. **Condition number** -- check key matrices (Jacobian, Hessian) for ill-conditioning
5. **Boundary check** -- verify variables respect bounds (non-negative shares, probabilities in [0,1])
6. **Input data** -- confirm data fed to solver contains no NaN/Inf/missing values
7. **Initial guess** -- check that x0 is feasible (satisfies bounds and constraints)

### Do NOT

- Change tolerances or solver options as a diagnostic step
- Change the solver algorithm without explicit approval
- Propose fixes before completing the diagnostic checklist
- Guess at root causes -- show evidence
- Add `try`/`catch` blocks just to suppress solver errors

### Report Format

Present diagnosis with evidence, then proposed fix. Wait for approval before implementing.

```markdown
## Diagnosis
- **Symptom:** [what failed]
- **First NaN/error at:** [file:line]
- **Root cause:** [with evidence]
- **Checklist completed:** [which steps, what was found]

## Proposed Fix
- [specific change with rationale]
- [expected outcome]
```

---

## General Trace Protocol

Use `/trace [observation]` when the main question is causal rather than
implementational.

Good fits:

- estimates changed unexpectedly
- merge or reshape outputs look wrong
- build dependencies behave unexpectedly
- outputs disagree across code, tables, and manuscript
- a failure is real but the cause is not yet clear

`/trace` should produce a ranked diagnosis with evidence, not a guessed fix.
For numerical solver failures, combine it with the solver debugging checklist
above.

---

## Output Verification Formats

When comparing outputs before and after code changes:

| Format | Checksum-Stable? | How to Compare |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| CSV/TSV | Yes | MD5 checksum |
| RDS | No (R-version dependent) | Read and compare values, or convert to CSV |
| .dta | Partially | Read and compare values, or export to CSV first |
| .mat | Partially | Load and compare specific variables |
| JLD2 | Yes (Julia-version dependent) | MD5 or load-and-compare |
| PDF/PNG | No (renderer dependent) | Visual diff only |
| .tex (generated) | Yes | MD5 or text diff |

**Gold standard:** CSV checksums. Use these for refactoring verification. Skip binary formats.

- **For `.dta` files:** compare with a reader such as `haven::read_dta()` or
  export both versions to CSV first.
- **For `.mat` files:** load both versions and compare variables with an
  explicit tolerance.
- **For `RDS` files:** compare with `all.equal()` or convert to CSV first.
- **For figures:** use visual inspection only; do not checksum PDF or PNG
  outputs.

---

## Research Orchestrator (Simplified)

> Use this simplified loop for single-file R/Stata script tasks. Use the same pattern for optional Julia/MATLAB scripts when a project includes them.

```
Plan approved -> orchestrator activates
  |
  Step 1: IMPLEMENT -- Execute plan steps
  |
  Step 2: VERIFY -- Run `make -n` to check staleness; build stale targets
  |         If Makefile exists: `make -C code/[dir] [target]` or `make -C latex`
  |         Otherwise: `Rscript` / `julia` / `stata -b do` / `matlab -batch` / `pdflatex` directly
  |         R scripts: runs without error, outputs created
  |         Julia scripts: runs without error, CSV/JLD2 created
  |         Stata scripts: runs without error, .dta/.csv/.tex outputs created
  |         MATLAB scripts: runs without error, .mat/.csv outputs created
  |         Simulations: set.seed / Random.seed! / set seed / rng reproducibility
  |         Plots: PDF/PNG created, correct format
  |         If verification fails -> fix -> re-verify
  |
  Step 3: SCORE -- Apply quality-gates rubric
  |
  └── Score >= 80?
        YES -> Done (commit when user signals)
        NO  -> Fix blocking issues, re-verify, re-score
```

**No 5-round loops. No multi-agent reviews. Just: write, test, done.**

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] `make -n` shows no stale targets (or targets rebuilt successfully)
- [ ] Script runs without errors (R, Julia, Stata, and/or MATLAB)
- [ ] Language setup is explicit at top (`library()`, `using`, `version`, `rng`)
- [ ] No hardcoded absolute paths
- [ ] `set.seed()` / `Random.seed!()` / `set seed` / `rng()` once at top if stochastic
- [ ] Output files created at expected paths
- [ ] Tolerance checks pass (if applicable)
- [ ] No hardcoded computed results in manuscript prose
- [ ] Quality score >= 80

---

## Plan-First Workflow

**For any non-trivial task, plan before writing code.**

### The Protocol

1. **Think through the approach** before coding
2. **Check MEMORY.md** for structured `[LEARN]` entries relevant to this task
3. **Draft the plan** -- what changes, which files, in what order
4. **Save to disk** -- write to `quality_reports/plans/YYYY-MM-DD_short-description.md`
5. **Manuscript review opt-in** -- if the task touches manuscript or slides (`latex/`), ask:
   - "Include domain substance review?" (runs `domain-reviewer` agent)
   - "Include proofreading?" (runs `proofreader` agent)
   - Record the answers in the saved plan under an `## Optional Reviews` section
6. **Present to user** -- wait for approval
7. **Implement via orchestrator** after approval

### Plans on Disk

Plans survive context loss. Save every plan to:

```
quality_reports/plans/YYYY-MM-DD_short-description.md
```

Format: Status (DRAFT/APPROVED/COMPLETED), approach, files to modify, verification steps.

### Context Management

- Prefer auto-compression over manual context clearing
- Save important context to disk before it is lost
- Use context clearing only when the working context is genuinely polluted

### Session Recovery

After compression or a new session:
1. Read `AGENTS.md` and the most recent plan in `quality_reports/plans/`
2. Read the most recent relevant handoff in `quality_reports/handoffs/`, if one exists
3. Check `git log --oneline -10` and `git diff`
4. State what you understand the current task to be

---

## Task Completion Verification Protocol

**At the end of EVERY task, verify the output works correctly.** This is non-negotiable.

### Make-First Verification

If a Makefile governs the files being modified:
1. Run `make -n` from the relevant directory to check what is stale
2. Build stale targets: `make -C code/[subdir] [target]` or `make -C latex`
3. Check exit code -- non-zero is a hard failure
4. Then proceed to file-specific checks below

### For LaTeX Manuscript:
1. Compile with `make -C latex` (preferred). Check for errors
2. Verify PDF was generated with non-zero size
3. Check for overfull hbox warnings
4. Check for undefined citations
5. Run `/review-tex` to check for hardcoded numbers in prose
6. Verify all dynamic number `\input{...}` files exist in `output/numbers/`

### For R Scripts:
1. Prefer `make -C code/[subdir] [target]`; fall back to `Rscript path/to/script.R`
2. Verify output files (PDF, RDS, CSV) were created with non-zero size
3. Spot-check estimates for reasonable magnitude

### For Julia Scripts:
1. Prefer `make -C code/[subdir] [target]`; fall back to `julia path/to/script.jl`
2. Verify output files (CSV, JLD2) were created with non-zero size
3. Check file sizes are plausible (not suspiciously small or empty)
4. If stochastic, verify reproducibility: run twice with same seed, diff outputs

### For Stata Scripts:
1. Prefer `make -C code/[subdir] [target]`; fall back to `stata -b do path/to/script.do`
2. Verify output files (`.dta`, `.csv`, `.tex`, `.txt`, or logs used downstream) were created with non-zero size
3. Check the batch log for Stata error codes and unexpected warnings
4. Spot-check key counts, merge assertions, or exported estimates for reasonable magnitude

### For MATLAB Scripts:
1. Prefer `make -C code/[subdir] [target]`; fall back to `matlab -batch "run('path/to/script.m')"`
2. Verify output files (`.mat`, `.csv`, `.tex`, or figures) were created with non-zero size
3. Check file sizes are plausible and solver output/logs show successful convergence where relevant

### For Code Pipelines:
1. When the task adds, renames, or restructures scripts under `code/`, verify
   that every `.R`, `.jl`, `.do`, `.ado`, and `.m` file appears as a
   prerequisite in some Makefile target.
2. Flag orphaned scripts as warnings. They may be dead code or missing from the
   build graph.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Relative paths:** use paths relative to the Makefile's directory
- **Assuming success:** verify output files exist and contain plausible content

### Verification Checklist:
```
[ ] Output file created successfully
[ ] No compilation/render errors
[ ] Images/figures display correctly
[ ] Reported results to user
```

---

## Session Logging

**Location:** `quality_reports/session_logs/YYYY-MM-DD_description.md`
**Template:** `templates/session-log.md`

### Three Triggers (all proactive)

1. **Post-Plan Log** -- After plan approval, immediately capture: goal, approach, rationale, key context.
2. **Incremental Logging** -- Append 1-3 lines whenever: a design decision is made, a problem is solved, the user corrects something, or the approach changes. Do not batch.
3. **End-of-Session Log** -- When wrapping up: high-level summary, quality scores, open questions, blockers.

### Quality Reports

Generated **only at merge time** -- not at every commit or PR.
Save to `quality_reports/merges/YYYY-MM-DD_[branch-name].md` using `templates/quality-report.md`.

## Structured Handoffs

**Location:** `quality_reports/handoffs/YYYY-MM-DD_description/`
**Template:** `templates/handoff.md`

Write handoffs only when stage boundaries matter. Each note should be short and
contain:

- decisions made
- alternatives rejected
- active risks
- files touched or relevant
- what the next stage must verify or do

## Structured Learning

Use `/learn` or append directly to `MEMORY.md` when a lesson is both
project-specific and likely to recur.

Required format:

```markdown
[LEARN:category]
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Trigger: [symptom, mistake, or question]
- Wrong: [incorrect assumption or behavior]
- Right: [correct rule or approach]
- Scope: [where this applies]
- Evidence: [file, command, output, or user correction]
- Action: [what to do next time]
```

Do not save generic advice. Save only durable lessons that would materially help
future work.

### Template Repo Hygiene

When maintaining this template repository itself, treat ad hoc files under
`quality_reports/` as branch-local artifacts. Before merging back to `main`,
remove task-specific plans, handoffs, session logs, merge reports, and scratch
directories so the template stays fresh. Keep only `.gitkeep` placeholders and
intentional template assets.

---

## Command Conventions

Issue one command per shell execution. Do not chain commands with `&&` or `;`. This keeps command execution predictable and matches the permission rules in `.codex/rules/default.rules`.

- **Independent commands** -- issue in parallel when possible (e.g., `git status` and `git diff`)
- **Dependent commands** -- issue sequentially, waiting for each result before the next (e.g., `git add` then `git commit`)

## Workflow Quick Reference

**Model:** Contractor (you direct, Codex orchestrates)

```
Your instruction -> [PLAN] (if needed) -> Your approval -> [EXECUTE] -> [REPORT] -> Repeat
