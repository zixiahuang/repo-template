# AGENTS.md -- Academic Project Development with Codex CLI

<!-- HOW TO USE: Replace [BRACKETED PLACEHOLDERS] with your project info.
     Keep this file under 32KB -- Codex loads it every session.
     Code-specific conventions are in code/AGENTS.md.
     LaTeX-specific conventions are in latex/AGENTS.md. -->

**Project:** [YOUR PROJECT NAME]
**Institution:** [YOUR INSTITUTION]

## Core Principles

- **Plan first** -- think through the approach before non-trivial tasks; save plans to `quality_reports/plans/`
- **Verify after** -- compile/render and confirm output at the end of every task
- **Single source of truth** -- `latex/manuscript.tex` is authoritative for the paper
- **Quality gates** -- nothing ships below 80/100
- **[LEARN] tags** -- when corrected, save `[LEARN:category] wrong -> right` to MEMORY.md

## Orchestrator Protocol: Contractor Mode

> Use this full loop for multi-file or cross-cutting changes. For single-file R/Julia script tasks, use the simplified research orchestrator below.

**After a plan is approved, the orchestrator takes over autonomously.**

### The Loop

```
Plan approved -> orchestrator activates
  |
  Step 1: IMPLEMENT -- Execute plan steps
  |
  Step 2: VERIFY -- Run `make -n` to check staleness; build stale targets
  |         If Makefile exists: `make -C code/[dir] [target]` or `make -C latex`
  |         Otherwise: compile/render/run directly
  |         If verification fails -> fix -> re-verify
  |
  Step 3: REVIEW -- Run appropriate review skill (/review-r, /review-julia, /review-tex)
  |
  Step 4: FIX -- Apply fixes (critical -> major -> minor)
  |
  Step 5: RE-VERIFY -- Confirm fixes are clean
  |
  Step 6: SCORE -- Apply quality-gates rubric
  |
  └── Score >= threshold?
        YES -> Present summary to user
        NO  -> Loop back to Step 3 (max 5 rounds)
              After max rounds -> present with remaining issues
```

### Limits

- **Main loop:** max 5 review-fix rounds
- **Critic-fixer sub-loop:** max 5 rounds
- **Verification retries:** max 2 attempts
- Never loop indefinitely

### "Just Do It" Mode

When user says "just do it" / "handle it":
- Skip final approval pause
- Auto-commit if score >= 80
- Still run the full verify-review-fix loop
- Still present the summary

## Research Orchestrator (Simplified)

> Use this simplified loop for single-file R/Julia script tasks.

```
Plan approved -> orchestrator activates
  |
  Step 1: IMPLEMENT -- Execute plan steps
  |
  Step 2: VERIFY -- Run `make -n` to check staleness; build stale targets
  |         If Makefile exists: `make -C code/[dir] [target]` or `make -C latex`
  |         Otherwise: `Rscript` / `julia` / `pdflatex` directly
  |         R scripts: runs without error, outputs created
  |         Julia scripts: runs without error, CSV/JLD2 created
  |         Simulations: set.seed / Random.seed! reproducibility
  |         Plots: PDF/PNG created, correct format
  |         If verification fails -> fix -> re-verify
  |
  Step 3: SCORE -- Apply quality-gates rubric
  |
  └── Score >= 80?
        YES -> Done (commit when user signals)
        NO  -> Fix blocking issues, re-verify, re-score
```

**No 5-round loops. No multi-agent reviews. Just: write, test, done.**

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] `make -n` shows no stale targets (or targets rebuilt successfully)
- [ ] Script runs without errors (R and/or Julia)
- [ ] All packages loaded at top (R: `library()`, Julia: top-level `using`)
- [ ] No hardcoded absolute paths
- [ ] `set.seed()` / `Random.seed!()` once at top if stochastic
- [ ] Output files created at expected paths
- [ ] Tolerance checks pass (if applicable)
- [ ] No hardcoded computed results in manuscript prose
- [ ] Quality score >= 80

## Plan-First Workflow

**For any non-trivial task, plan before writing code.**

### The Protocol

1. **Think through the approach** before coding
2. **Check MEMORY.md** for `[LEARN]` entries relevant to this task
3. **Draft the plan** -- what changes, which files, in what order
4. **Save to disk** -- write to `quality_reports/plans/YYYY-MM-DD_short-description.md`
5. **Present to user** -- wait for approval
6. **Implement via orchestrator** after approval

### Plans on Disk

Plans survive context loss. Save every plan to:

```
quality_reports/plans/YYYY-MM-DD_short-description.md
```

Format: Status (DRAFT/APPROVED/COMPLETED), approach, files to modify, verification steps.

### Context Management

- Prefer auto-compression over manual context clearing
- Save important context to disk before it is lost
- Use context clearing only when the working context is genuinely polluted

### Session Recovery

After compression or a new session:
1. Read `AGENTS.md` and the most recent plan in `quality_reports/plans/`
2. Check `git log --oneline -10` and `git diff`
3. State what you understand the current task to be

### Enforcement

- **Score < 80:** Block commit. List blocking issues.
- **Score < 90:** Allow commit, warn. List recommendations.
- User can override with justification.

### Tolerance Thresholds (Research)

<!-- Customize for your domain -->

| Quantity | Tolerance | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Point estimates | [e.g., 1e-6] | [Numerical precision] |
| Standard errors | [e.g., 1e-4] | [MC variability] |
| Coverage rates | [e.g., +/- 0.01] | [MC with B reps] |

---

## Task Completion Verification Protocol

**At the end of EVERY task, verify the output works correctly.** This is non-negotiable.

### Make-First Verification

If a Makefile governs the files being modified:
1. Run `make -n` from the relevant directory to check what is stale
2. Build stale targets: `make -C code/[subdir] [target]` or `make -C latex`
3. Check exit code -- non-zero is a hard failure
4. Then proceed to file-specific checks below

### For LaTeX Manuscript:
1. Compile with `make -C latex` (preferred). Check for errors
2. Verify PDF was generated with non-zero size
3. Check for overfull hbox warnings
4. Check for undefined citations
5. Run `/review-tex` to check for hardcoded numbers in prose
6. Verify all dynamic number `\input{...}` files exist in `output/numbers/`

### For R Scripts:
1. Prefer `make -C code/[subdir] [target]`; fall back to `Rscript path/to/script.R`
2. Verify output files (PDF, RDS, CSV) were created with non-zero size
3. Spot-check estimates for reasonable magnitude

### For Julia Scripts:
1. Prefer `make -C code/[subdir] [target]`; fall back to `julia path/to/script.jl`
2. Verify output files (CSV, JLD2) were created with non-zero size
3. Check file sizes are plausible (not suspiciously small or empty)
4. If stochastic, verify reproducibility: run twice with same seed, diff outputs

### Verification Checklist:
```
[ ] Output file created successfully
[ ] No compilation/render errors
[ ] Images/figures display correctly
[ ] Reported results to user
```

## Session Logging

**Location:** `quality_reports/session_logs/YYYY-MM-DD_description.md`
**Template:** `templates/session-log.md`

### Three Triggers (all proactive)

1. **Post-Plan Log** -- After plan approval, immediately capture: goal, approach, rationale, key context.
2. **Incremental Logging** -- Append 1-3 lines whenever: a design decision is made, a problem is solved, the user corrects something, or the approach changes. Do not batch.
3. **End-of-Session Log** -- When wrapping up: high-level summary, quality scores, open questions, blockers.

### Quality Reports

Generated **only at merge time** -- not at every commit or PR.
Save to `quality_reports/merges/YYYY-MM-DD_[branch-name].md` using `templates/quality-report.md`.

---

## Command Conventions

Issue one command per shell execution. Do not chain commands with `&&` or `;`. This keeps command execution predictable and matches the permission rules in `.codex/rules/default.rules`.

- **Independent commands** -- issue in parallel when possible (e.g., `git status` and `git diff`)
- **Dependent commands** -- issue sequentially, waiting for each result before the next (e.g., `git add` then `git commit`)

---

## Replication-First Protocol

**Core principle:** Replicate original results to the dot BEFORE extending.

### Phase 1: Inventory & Baseline

Before writing any code:
- Read the paper's replication README
- Inventory replication package: language, data files, scripts, outputs
- Record gold standard numbers from the paper
- Store targets in `quality_reports/[project]_replication_targets.md` or as RDS

### Phase 2: Translate & Execute

- Follow code conventions for all coding standards
- Translate line-by-line initially -- don't "improve" during replication
- Match original specification exactly
- Save all intermediate results as RDS or JLD2

#### Stata to R Translation Pitfalls

| Stata | R | Trap |
|-------|---|------|
| `reg y x, cluster(id)` | `feols(y ~ x, cluster = ~id)` | Stata clusters df-adjust differently from some R packages |
| `areg y x, absorb(id)` | `feols(y ~ x \| id)` | Check demeaning method matches |
| `probit` for PS | `glm(family=binomial(link="probit"))` | R default logit differs from probit defaults in some workflows |
| `bootstrap, reps(999)` | Depends on method | Match seed, reps, and bootstrap type exactly |

### Phase 3: Verify Match

| Type | Tolerance | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Integers (N, counts) | Exact match | No reason for any difference |
| Point estimates | < 0.01 | Rounding in paper display |
| Standard errors | < 0.05 | Bootstrap/clustering variation |
| P-values | Same significance level | Exact p may differ slightly |
| Percentages | < 0.1pp | Display rounding |

**If mismatch:** Do NOT proceed to extensions. Isolate which step introduces the difference.

#### Replication Report

Save to `quality_reports/[project]_replication_report.md`:

```markdown
# Replication Report: [Paper Author (Year)]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Original language:** [Stata/R/etc.]
**R translation:** [script path]

## Summary
- **Targets checked / Passed / Failed:** N / M / K
- **Overall:** [REPLICATED / PARTIAL / FAILED]

## Results Comparison

| Target | Paper | Ours | Diff | Status |
|--------|-------|------|------|--------|

## Discrepancies (if any)
- **Target:** X | **Investigation:** ... | **Resolution:** ...

## Environment
- R version, key packages (with versions), data source
```

### Phase 4: Only Then Extend

After replication is verified (all targets PASS), commit and begin extensions.

## Workflow Quick Reference

**Model:** Contractor (you direct, Codex orchestrates)

```
Your instruction -> [PLAN] (if needed) -> Your approval -> [EXECUTE] -> [REPORT] -> Repeat
```

**Ask the user when:** Design forks, code ambiguity, replication edge cases, scope questions.
**Just execute when:** Obvious fixes, verification, documentation, plotting, deployment.
