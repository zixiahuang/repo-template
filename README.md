# AI-Assisted Academic Research Template (Make + R/Julia/Stata/MATLAB)

> **Work in progress.** This is a summary of how I use AI coding assistants for computational research — running analysis pipelines with Make, writing R, Julia, Stata, and MATLAB scripts, and managing build dependencies. I keep updating these files as I learn new things.

A ready-to-fork starter kit for researchers using [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) or [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) with **Make + R + Julia + Stata + MATLAB** build systems. You describe what you want; the assistant plans the approach, implements it, builds via Make, traces ambiguous failures, runs specialized review skills, records handoffs and durable learnings, fixes issues, and presents results — like a contractor who handles the entire job.

**Both tools are supported.** Claude Code uses a `CLAUDE.md` hierarchy plus
`.claude/`; Codex CLI uses an `AGENTS.md` hierarchy plus `.codex/` and
`.agents/`. The same workflow, quality gates, and skills work with either.

---

## Quick Start: Claude Code (5 minutes)

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork this repo on GitHub (click "Fork" on the repo page), then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/repo-template.git my-project
cd my-project
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### 2. Start Claude Code and Paste This Prompt

```bash
claude
```

**Using VS Code?** Open the Claude Code panel instead. Everything works the same.

Then paste the following, filling in your project details:

> I am starting to work on **[PROJECT NAME]** in this repo. **[Describe your project in 2–3 sentences — what you're building, what data you use, what your pipeline stages are (e.g., data cleaning, estimation, figures).]**
>
> I want our collaboration to be structured, precise, and rigorous. Code should be reproducible and build-system driven.
>
> I've set up the Claude Code academic workflow (forked from `irudik/repo-template`). The configuration files are already in this repo. Please read them, understand the workflow, and then **update all configuration files to fit my project** — fill in placeholders in `CLAUDE.md`, set up the `code/` directory structure with sub-Makefiles for my pipeline stages, and propose any customizations specific to my use case.
>
> After that, use the plan-first workflow for all non-trivial tasks. Once I approve a plan, switch to contractor mode — coordinate everything autonomously and only come back to me when there's ambiguity or a decision to make.
>
> Enter plan mode and start by adapting the workflow configuration for this project.

**What this does:** Claude reads the root and nested `CLAUDE.md` files plus the
tool-specific `.claude/` configuration, sets up your `code/` directory with
sub-Makefiles for each pipeline stage, fills in your project details, then
enters contractor mode — planning, implementing, reviewing, and verifying
autonomously.

### 3. Configure Hooks (Optional)

Hooks are configured per-user in `.claude/settings.json` (gitignored by default). To enable the bundled hooks, create the file with the format below. The `hooks` key uses nested arrays with optional `matcher` and `timeout` fields. `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` resolves to the project root at runtime.

```bash
cat > .claude/settings.json << 'EOF'
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/log-reminder.py",
            "timeout": 10
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Notification": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/notify.sh",
            "timeout": 5
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/protect-files.sh",
            "timeout": 5
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreCompact": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/pre-compact.sh",
            "timeout": 5
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
EOF
```

## Quick Start: Codex CLI (5 minutes)

### 1. Fork & Clone

Same as above — fork this repo, clone it, and `cd` into it.

### 2. Start Codex CLI and Paste This Prompt

```bash
codex
```

Then paste the same project-description prompt as the Claude Code section above.

**What this does:** Codex reads `AGENTS.md` (root + `code/AGENTS.md` + `latex/AGENTS.md`), understands the full workflow, and configures the project.

### 3. Configuration

Codex project configuration lives in:

- **`AGENTS.md`** (root) — project instructions and workflow rules (loaded every session)
- **`code/AGENTS.md`** — R, Julia, Stata, MATLAB, and Makefile conventions (loaded when working in `code/`)
- **`latex/AGENTS.md`** — LaTeX conventions (loaded when working in `latex/`)
- **`protocols/skills/*.md`** — canonical shared skill bodies for both tools
- **`.codex/config.toml`** — model, sandbox, and approval settings
- **`.codex/rules/default.rules`** — command execution permissions (Starlark format)
- **`.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`** — thin Codex wrappers around the shared protocols

### Codex vs Claude Code: Key Differences

| Aspect | Claude Code | Codex CLI |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Instructions file | `CLAUDE.md` hierarchy | `AGENTS.md` hierarchy |
| Settings | `.claude/settings.json` (JSON) | `.codex/config.toml` (TOML) |
| Permission rules | Glob patterns in settings.json | `.codex/rules/default.rules` (Starlark) |
| Project conventions | `CLAUDE.md` hierarchy plus shared `AGENTS.md` local conventions | `AGENTS.md` hierarchy |
| Shared skill bodies | `protocols/skills/*.md` | `protocols/skills/*.md` |
| Agent definitions | `.claude/agents/*.md` | Not supported |
| Skills | Thin wrappers in `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Thin wrappers in `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` |
| Hooks | `.claude/hooks/*` | Not supported (use git hooks) |

### Known Limitations (Codex)

Codex CLI does not support hooks, so these Claude Code features have no direct equivalent:
- **File protection** (`.claude/hooks/protect-files.sh`) — be careful editing `references.bib` and `settings.json`
- **Session log reminders** (`.claude/hooks/log-reminder.py`) — manually update session logs
- **Context snapshot before compaction** (`.claude/hooks/pre-compact.sh`) — save context to plans/ manually
- **Desktop notifications** (`.claude/hooks/notify.sh`) — not available

## How It Works

### Make as the Backbone

A root Makefile delegates to `code/` (analysis pipeline) and `latex/` (manuscript):

```
my-project/
├── Makefile              # Root — delegates to code/ and latex/
├── code/
│   ├── Makefile          # Delegates to sub-Makefiles
│   ├── data_prep/
│   │   ├── Makefile      # Targets for cleaning raw data
│   │   ├── clean.do
│   │   └── merge.R
│   ├── estimation/
│   │   ├── Makefile      # Targets for running models
│   │   ├── model.R
│   │   └── bootstrap.R
│   ├── simulation/
│   │   ├── Makefile      # Targets for trade model simulation
│   │   ├── simulate_trade.jl
│   │   └── process_results.jl
│   ├── structural_model/
│   │   ├── Makefile      # Targets for numerical optimization
│   │   └── solve_equilibrium.m
│   ├── tables/
│   │   ├── Makefile      # Targets for regression tables
│   │   └── reg_tables.do
│   └── figures/
│       ├── Makefile      # Targets for generating plots
│       └── main_figures.R
└── latex/
    ├── Makefile          # pdflatex 3-pass build
    ├── manuscript.tex    # Main paper
    ├── slides.tex        # Presentation slides
    ├── latex_extras/     # Preamble files
    └── references/       # .bib and .bst files
```

- `make` from project root builds everything (code first, then latex)
- `make -n` shows what would be rebuilt (dry-run)
- `make -C code` rebuilds all code targets
- `make -C code/estimation all` rebuilds one pipeline stage
- `make -C latex` compiles the manuscript
- Scripts never create directories — Makefiles own that via order-only prerequisites

### Contractor Mode

You describe a task. Claude:
1. **Plans** the approach (enter plan mode, save to disk)
2. **Implements** the code
3. **Writes handoff notes** at major stage boundaries for cross-cutting tasks
4. **Verifies** via `make -n` then `make` — builds stale targets (including `make -C latex` for the manuscript), checks exit codes
5. **Reviews** with specialized agents (r-reviewer, julia-reviewer, stata-reviewer, matlab-reviewer, makefile-reviewer, tracer when diagnosis is needed)
6. **Fixes** issues found by reviewers or traces
7. **Captures durable learnings** in `MEMORY.md` when non-obvious lessons emerge
8. **Scores** against quality gates

If the score meets threshold, Claude presents a summary. Say "just do it" and it auto-commits too.

### PR Review (`/review-pr`)

When reviewers leave comments on a pull request, `/review-pr <PR#>` automates the triage-fix-reply loop:

1. **Fetches** all unresolved review threads via GitHub's GraphQL API
2. **Classifies** each thread by confidence:
   - **HIGH** — clear code fix (typo, bug, missing import). Implements, commits, replies with the commit hash, and resolves the thread.
   - **MEDIUM** — ambiguous but likely intent. Implements and stages changes but does *not* commit. Presents the interpretation for your approval.
   - **LOW** — design question or unclear fix. Reports the thread with a suggested approach. No code changes.
3. **Groups** fixes by file so each commit is atomic
4. **Runs the orchestrator mini-loop** on each group (implement, verify via Make, review, score)
5. **Pushes** and prints a summary table of what was addressed, what needs approval, and what needs your input

Outdated threads (code has moved since the comment) are reported but never touched.

### Trace (`/trace`)

When the main question is causal rather than implementational, `/trace` runs a
diagnostic workflow that:

1. Restates the observation
2. Generates competing hypotheses
3. Collects evidence for and against each explanation
4. Ranks the explanations by evidence strength
5. Recommends the single best next probe

This is useful for estimate shifts, merge-key problems, stale build behavior,
solver failures, and code-manuscript mismatches.

### Structured Handoffs and Learning

For multi-file tasks, the workflow can write short handoff notes under
`quality_reports/handoffs/` so planning, implementation, verification, and
review do not depend only on live context. Durable project-specific lessons are
stored in `MEMORY.md` using structured `[LEARN:category]` entries rather than
loose bullets.

### Specialized Agents

Focused agents each check one dimension:

| Agent | What It Checks |
|-------|---------------|
| `r-reviewer` | R code quality, reproducibility, domain correctness |
| `julia-reviewer` | Julia code quality, type stability, performance |
| `stata-reviewer` | Stata code quality, data integrity, and research workflow safety |
| `matlab-reviewer` | MATLAB code quality, solver configuration, derivative correctness |
| `domain-reviewer` | Substantive manuscript/slide review: identification, derivations, citations, code-theory alignment |
| `proofreader` | Grammar, typos, overflow risks, and consistency for academic documents |
| `makefile-reviewer` | Makefile conventions, dependency correctness, script coverage |
| `tracer` | Evidence-driven diagnosis for ambiguous failures and output shifts |

For manuscript or slide tasks, the orchestrator can also run **opt-in review passes** after the review-fix loop completes:
- `domain-reviewer` for substantive identification and citation checks
- `proofreader` for grammar, overflow, and consistency checks

These run once on the final state and produce reports only — fixes require user review.

### Quality Gates

Every file gets a score (0–100). Scores below threshold block the action:
- **80** — commit threshold
- **90** — PR threshold
- **95** — excellence (aspirational)

Rubrics cover R scripts, Julia scripts, Stata scripts, MATLAB scripts, Makefiles, and LaTeX manuscripts. See `AGENTS.md` for the full deduction table.

### Shared Skill Protocols (`protocols/skills/`)

Canonical bodies for all 20 shared skills. Both `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` point at these files, and Claude review agents execute the same protocol files rather than owning separate copies.

### Shared Guidance Surfaces

| File | What It Covers |

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Required For | Install |
|------|-------------|---------|
| [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) or [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) | AI assistant | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` or `npm install -g @openai/codex` |
| [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) | Build system | Pre-installed on macOS/Linux |
| R | Data analysis, figures | [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/) |
| Julia | Computation, simulation | [julialang.org](https://julialang.org/downloads/) |
| Stata | Replication, cleaning, and panel workflows | Vendor installer; ensure `stata-mp`, `stata-se`, or `stata` is on `PATH` |
| MATLAB | Numerical optimization and structural models | MathWorks installer; ensure `matlab` is on `PATH` |
| pdflatex | Manuscript compilation | Included with TeX Live / MacTeX |
| [gh CLI](https://cli.github.com/) | PR workflow | `brew install gh` (macOS) |
| [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) | Claude Code hooks and `/review-pr` thread parsing | `brew install jq` (macOS) |

Not all tools are needed — install only what your project uses. Either Claude Code or Codex CLI is the only hard requirement.

By default, this template does not pin an AI model for either tool. Codex CLI uses the default model from your local Codex CLI setup (for example `~/.codex/config.toml` or an explicit `codex --model ...` override), and Claude Code uses the default model configured in your local Claude Code CLI/app session. If you want a repo-specific model, add that pin yourself.

## Dynamic Numbers in LaTeX

The pipeline keeps computed results out of your `.tex` source by writing `\newcommand` definitions to `output/numbers/` and resolving them at compile time via `TEXINPUTS`.

### How it works

1. **Code generates a `.txt` file** with a `\newcommand`.
   In the standard `code/[task_group]/` layout, task-group scripts reach the
   repo-root `output/` directory via a working-directory-relative
   `output_root`:

   **R:**
   ```r
   output_root = file.path("..", "..", "output")
   writeLines("\\newcommand{\\revenueEstimate}{4.72}",
              file.path(output_root, "numbers", "revenue_estimate.txt"))
   ```

   **Julia:**
   ```julia
   output_root = joinpath("..", "..", "output")
   open(joinpath(output_root, "numbers", "revenue_estimate.txt"), "w") do io
       println(io, "\\newcommand{\\revenueEstimate}{4.72}")
   end
   ```

   **Stata:**
   ```stata
   local output_root "../../output"
   file open fh using "`output_root'/numbers/revenue_estimate.txt", write text replace
   file write fh "\newcommand{\revenueEstimate}{4.72}" _n
   file close fh
   ```

   **MATLAB:**
   ```matlab
   output_root = fullfile("..", "..", "output");
   fid = fopen(fullfile(output_root, "numbers", "revenue_estimate.txt"), "w");
   fprintf(fid, '\\newcommand{\\revenueEstimate}{4.72}\n');
   fclose(fid);
   ```

2. **The manuscript inputs the file** (plain filename — no path prefix needed):
   ```latex
   \input{revenue_estimate.txt}
   A U.S. carbon tariff raises \$\revenueEstimate\ billion in revenue.
   ```

3. **`TEXINPUTS` resolves the path.** The `latex/Makefile` exports:
   ```make
   export TEXINPUTS := .:./latex_extras/:../output/numbers/:../output/tables/:../output/figures/:
   ```
   So `pdflatex` finds `revenue_estimate.txt` in `../output/numbers/` without your `.tex` files needing `../output/` prefixes.

### Adding a new dynamic number

1. Add the write call to your R, Julia, Stata, or MATLAB script
2. Add the `.txt` file as a prerequisite in the relevant `code/` Makefile
3. Add `\input{filename.txt}` in the manuscript preamble (or wherever the macro is first used)
4. Use the macro (`\revenueEstimate`) in prose
5. Run `make` — the code pipeline writes the file, then `pdflatex` picks it up

The same `TEXINPUTS` mechanism resolves figures (`output/figures/`) and tables (`output/tables/`), so `\includegraphics{plot.pdf}` and `\input{reg_table.tex}` also work without path prefixes.

## Maintenance: Keeping Claude and Codex in Sync

This repo now uses a three-layer skill architecture:

- **`protocols/skills/`** — canonical shared skill bodies
- **`.claude/skills/`** — Claude wrappers
- **`.agents/skills/`** — Codex wrappers

Claude also has a tool-specific execution layer in **`.claude/agents/`** for review-oriented skills. Those agents execute the same shared protocol files rather than owning separate checklists.

### What must stay in sync

| Component | Location | Keep in sync? |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Command permissions | `.claude/settings.json.example` and `.codex/rules/default.rules` | Yes |
| Shared skill bodies | `protocols/skills/*.md` | Yes |
| Skill wrapper names and descriptions | `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` and `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Yes |
| Project conventions | `CLAUDE.md`, `code/CLAUDE.md`, `latex/CLAUDE.md`, and the `AGENTS.md` hierarchy | Yes |

### What intentionally differs

- **Frontmatter format.** Claude wrappers use Claude frontmatter; Codex wrappers use Codex frontmatter.
- **Agent layer.** Claude has `.claude/agents/` for review-oriented execution surfaces. Codex does not.
- **Hooks.** Claude supports `.claude/hooks/`; Codex does not.

### When adding a new skill or convention

1. Add or update the canonical body in `protocols/skills/<name>.md`
2. Update `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
3. Update `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
4. If it is a review-oriented Claude agent surface, update the matching file in `.claude/agents/`
5. If the skill needs new commands, update both permission config files
6. Run `make check-template`

## Template Consistency Checker

Run `make check-template` to validate:

- permission parity between Claude and Codex configs
- shared protocol and wrapper inventory parity
- wrapper references to `protocols/skills/*.md`
- Claude review-agent references to the same canonical protocol files

## Fresh Main Branch

When maintaining this template repo itself, treat ad hoc files under
`quality_reports/` as branch-local working artifacts rather than permanent
template content. Before merging back to `main`, remove task-specific plans,
handoffs, session logs, merge reports, and scratch directories so the default
branch ships clean. Keep only placeholder `.gitkeep` files and intentional
template assets.

```

Each `code/[task_group]/Makefile` follows the conventions in `code/AGENTS.md`: `all` and `clean` targets, order-only prerequisites for directories, pattern rules for parametric outputs, and `.PRECIOUS` for expensive intermediates.
