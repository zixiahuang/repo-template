# CLAUDE.md -- Academic Project Development with Claude Code

<!-- HOW TO USE: Replace [BRACKETED PLACEHOLDERS] with your project info.
     Keep this root file under ~150 lines — Claude loads it every session.
     See README.md for full documentation. -->

**Project:** [YOUR PROJECT NAME]
**Institution:** [YOUR INSTITUTION]

## Core Principles

- **Plan first** -- enter plan mode before non-trivial tasks; save plans to `quality_reports/plans/`
- **Verify after** -- compile/render and confirm output at the end of every task
- **Single source of truth** -- `latex/manuscript.tex` is authoritative for the paper
- **Quality gates** -- nothing ships below 80/100
- **Template hygiene** -- in this template repo, remove branch-specific files under `quality_reports/` before merging to `main`; keep `main` fresh
- **Structured [LEARN] tags** -- when corrected or when you discover a durable lesson, save a structured `[LEARN:category]` entry to `MEMORY.md`

## Commands

```bash
# Make (preferred — builds everything)
make                               # Build all (code + latex)
make -n                            # Dry-run: show what would be built
make check-template                # Validate shared-skill and permission sync
make -C code                       # Build all code targets
make -C code/[task_group] all      # Build one task group
make -C latex                      # Compile manuscript

# LaTeX (manual fallback — 3-pass, pdflatex)
cd latex
export TEXINPUTS=.:./latex_extras/:../output/numbers/:../output/tables/:../output/figures/:
export BIBINPUTS=./references/:
export BSTINPUTS=./references/:
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode manuscript.tex
bibtex manuscript
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode manuscript.tex
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode manuscript.tex
```

## Shared Skill Protocols

- Canonical shared skill bodies live in `protocols/skills/`
- `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` are thin wrappers around those files
- Review-oriented agents in `.claude/agents/` execute the same canonical protocols

## Claude Loading Model

- Root `CLAUDE.md` sets project-wide workflow rules
- `code/CLAUDE.md` loads when Claude works in `code/`
- `latex/CLAUDE.md` loads when Claude works in `latex/`
- Shared local conventions live in `AGENTS.md`, `code/AGENTS.md`, and
  `latex/AGENTS.md`
- `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/hooks/` remain Claude-only execution surfaces
  and mechanics

## Claude-Specific Notes

- Enter plan mode before non-trivial tasks and exit only after the user
  approves the plan
- Prefer auto-compression over `/clear`; use `/clear` only when context is
  genuinely polluted
- After compression or a new session, read `CLAUDE.md`, read the most recent
  plan in `quality_reports/plans/`, read the most recent relevant handoff in
  `quality_reports/handoffs/` if one exists, then inspect
  `git log --oneline -10` and `git diff`

---

## Current Project State

| Component | File | Status | Description |
|-----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Manuscript | `latex/manuscript.tex` | Template | Paper skeleton with standard sections |
| Slides | `latex/slides.tex` | Template | Presentation template |
| Code pipeline | `code/` | Template | Sub-Makefiles to be added per project |

---

## Plan-First Notes

For manuscript or slide tasks, ask during planning whether to include these optional review passes:
- `domain-reviewer` for substantive domain review (identification, derivations, citations, code-theory alignment)
- `proofreader` for grammar, typos, overflow, and consistency

For multi-file tasks, write short handoff notes under
`quality_reports/handoffs/` at major stage boundaries.

When a durable, project-specific lesson emerges, save it to `MEMORY.md` with a
structured `[LEARN:category]` block or use `/learn`.
