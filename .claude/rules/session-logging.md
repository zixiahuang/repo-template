# Session Logging

**Location:** `quality_reports/session_logs/YYYY-MM-DD_description.md`
**Template:** `templates/session-log.md`

## Three Triggers (all proactive)

### 1. Post-Plan Log

After plan approval, immediately capture: goal, approach, rationale, key context.

### 2. Incremental Logging

Append 1-3 lines whenever: a design decision is made, a problem is solved, the user corrects something, or the approach changes. Do not batch.

### 3. End-of-Session Log

When wrapping up: high-level summary, quality scores, open questions, blockers.

## Quality Reports

Generated **only at merge time** -- not at every commit or PR.
Save to `quality_reports/merges/YYYY-MM-DD_[branch-name].md` using `templates/quality-report.md`.

## Template Repo Hygiene

When maintaining this template repository itself, treat ad hoc files under
`quality_reports/` as branch-local artifacts. Before merging back to `main`,
remove task-specific plans, session logs, merge reports, and scratch
directories so the template stays fresh. Keep only `.gitkeep` placeholders and
intentional template assets.
